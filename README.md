_A small game project dedicated to my little brother who continuously pesters me to play with him._

This version of Battleship is not the traditional strategy-type guessing game with two players (although it does support it). Although they are very similar in nature, the game mechanics and rules have been adapted and are more complex than the original version. In total, there are three major game modes available:
- **Single player** [Arcade / Realistic / Competitive]
- **Two player**    [Traditional / Arcade / Realistic / Competitive]
- **LAN**           [Traditional / Arcade / Realistic / Competitive]

To learn more about the game mechanics and differences between each game mode, please read the included [Guide]() which also includes instructions on how to customize the game by fine-tuning the settings.
